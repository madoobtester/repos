<pre>Syntax
         ps <i>option(s)</i>
</pre>
<p>This version of ps accepts 3 kinds of option:</p>
<ol>
<li> UNIX options, which may be grouped and must be preceded by a            dash.        </li>
<li> BSD options, which may be grouped and must not be used with a            dash. </li>
<li> GNU long options, which are preceded by two dashes.</li>
</ol>
<p> Options of different types can be freely mixed, but conflicts can        appear.  There are some synonymous options, which are functionally        identical, due to the many standards and ps implementations that this        ps is compatible with.</p>
<p>Note that &quot;ps -aux&quot; is distinct from &quot;ps aux&quot;.  The POSIX and UNIX        standards require that &quot;ps -aux&quot; print all processes owned by a user        named &quot;x&quot;, as well as printing all processes that would be selected        by the -a option.  If the user named &quot;x&quot; does not exist, this ps may        interpret the command as &quot;ps aux&quot; instead and print a warning.  This        behavior is intended to aid in transitioning old scripts and habits.        It is fragile, subject to change, and thus should not be relied upon.</p>
<p>By default, ps selects all processes with the same effective user ID        (euid=EUID) as the current user and associated with the same terminal        as the invoker.  It displays the process ID (pid=PID), the terminal        associated with the process (tname=TTY), the cumulated CPU time in        [DD-]hh:mm:ss format (time=TIME), and the executable name (ucmd=CMD).        Output is unsorted by default.</p>
<p>The use of BSD-style options will add process state (stat=STAT) to        the default display and show the command args (args=<i>COMMAND</i>) instead        of the executable name.  You can override this with the PS_FORMAT        environment variable.  </p>
<p>The use of BSD-style options will also change        the process selection to include processes on other terminals (TTYs)        that are owned by you; alternately, this may be described as setting        the selection to be the set of all processes filtered to exclude        processes owned by other users or not on a terminal.  These effects        are not considered when options are described as being &quot;identical&quot;        below, so -M will be considered identical to Z and so on.</p>
<p>Except as described below, process selection options are additive.        The default selection is discarded, and then the selected processes        are added to the set of processes to be displayed.  A process will        thus be shown if it meets any of the given selection criteria.<br>
</p>
<h2>Simple Process Selection:<br>
</h2>
<pre>   -A         Select all processes, including those of other users.
   -a         Select all processes except both session leaders (see getsid(2)) and
              processes not associated with a terminal.
    a         Lift the BSD-style &quot;only yourself&quot; restriction, which is imposed upon
              the set of all processes when some BSD-style (without &quot;-&quot;) options are
              used or when the ps personality setting is BSD-like.

   -d         Select all processes except session leaders.
   --deselect Negate selection.
   -e         Select all processes, including those of other users.

    g         Really all, even session leaders. This flag is obsolete and may be
              discontinued in a future release.
   -N         Negate selection.
    r         Restrict output to running processes
    T         Select all processes associated with this terminal.
              Identical to the t option without any argument.
    x         Lift the BSD-style &quot;must have a tty&quot; restriction, which is imposed upon
              the set of all processes when some BSD-style (without &quot;-&quot;) options are
              used or when the ps personality setting is BSD-like.</pre>
<h2> Process Selection by List:</h2>
<pre>
   -C <i>cmdlist</i>      Select by Command name, processes whose executable name is in cmdlist.
                   The command name is not the same as the command line.
                   Previous versions of procps and the kernel truncated this
                   command name to 15 characters. This limitation is no longer
                   present in both. If you depended on matching only 15 characters,
                   you may no longer get a match.

   -g <i>grplist</i>      Select by session OR by effective group name.
                   This ps will select by session when the list is completely numeric
                   (as sessions are).  Group ID numbers will work only when some group
                   names are also specified. 

   --group <i>grplist</i> Select by effective group ID (EGID) or Name.
                   The effective group ID describes the group whose file access
                   permissions are used by the process (see getegid(2)).
                   The -g option is often an alternative to --group.

   -G <i>grplist</i>      Select by Real Group ID (RGID) or Name.
   --Group <i>grplist</i> Select by Real Group ID (RGID) or Name.

   -p <i>pidlist</i>      Select by process ID (PID)
   --pid <i>pidlist</i>   Select by process ID (PID)
    p <i>pidlist</i>      Select by process ID (PID)

   --ppid <i>pidlist</i>  Select by parent process ID.
                   This selects the processes with a parent process ID
                   in pidlist. That is, it selects processes that are
                   children of those listed in <i>pidlist</i>.

   --quick-pid <i>pidlist</i>  Select by process ID (quick mode).
    q <i>pidlist</i>      Select by process ID (quick mode).
                      Quick mode doesn't apply additional filtering rules.
                      The order of pids is unsorted and preserved.
                      No additional selection options, sorting and forest type
                      listings are allowed in this mode. 

   -s <i>sesslist</i>     Select by session ID.
   --sid <i>sesslist</i>  Select by session ID.

   -t <i>ttylist</i>      Select by terminal (tty)
   --tty <i>ttylist</i>   Select by terminal (tty)
                      Terminals (ttys, or screens for text output) can be
                      specified in several forms: /dev/ttyS1, ttyS1, S1.
                      A plain &quot;-&quot; may be used to select processes not attached
                      to any terminal.

    t <i>ttylist</i>      Select by tty. Nearly identical to -t and --tty,
                   but can also be used with an empty ttylist to indicate
                   the terminal associated with ps.
                   Using the T option (Simple Process Selection above) is
                   considered cleaner than using T with an empty ttylist.


   -U <i>userlist</i>     Select by Real User ID (RUID) or Name.
   --User <i>userlist</i> Select by Real User ID (RUID) or Name. (Same as -U)
                   The real user ID identifies the user who created the process.

   -u <i>userlist</i>     Select by effective user ID (EUID) or Name.
   --user <i>userlist</i> Select by effective user ID (EUID) or Name.
    U <i>userlist</i>     Select by effective user ID (EUID) or Name.
                   The effective user ID describes the user whose file access
                   permissions are used by the process (see geteuid(2)

   -<i>123</i>      implied --sid
   <i>123</i>       implied --pid
</pre>
<h2> Output Format Control:<br>
</h2>
<pre>
   -c         Different scheduler info for -l option.
   -F         Extra Full listing. See the -f option, which -F implies.
   -f         Full-format listing.
              This can be combined with many other UNIX-style options to add
              additional columns. It also causes the command arguments to be
              printed. When used with -L, the NLWP (number of threads) and LWP
              (thread ID) columns will be added. See the c option, the format
              keyword args, and the format keyword comm.

  --format <i>format</i>
              user-defined format.  Identical to -o and o.

   -j         Jobs format.
    j         BSD job control format.
   -l         Long format. The -y option is often useful with this.
    l         Display BSD long format.

   -M         Add a column of security data.  Identical to Z (for SELinux).

    O <i>format</i>  Is preloaded o (overloaded).
              The BSD O option can act like -O (user-defined output format with
              some common fields predefined) or can be used to specify sort order.
              Heuristics are used to determine the behavior of this option.
              To ensure that the desired behavior is obtained (sorting or formatting),
              specify the option in some other way (e.g. with -O or --sort).
              When used as a formatting option, it is identical to -O, with the BSD
              personality.

   -O <i>format</i>  is like -o, but preloaded with some default columns.
              Identical to -o pid,format,state,tname,time,command
                       or  -o pid,format,tname,time,cmd,  see -o below.

   -o <i>format</i>  Display in a <a href="ps_keywords.html">user-defined format</a> (space or comma separated).
   --format   Display in a <a href="ps_keywords.html">user-defined format</a> (space or comma separated).
    o <i>format</i>  Display in a <a href="ps_keywords.html">user-defined format</a> (space or comma separated).
                 Headers may be renamed (ps -o pid, ruser=RealUser -o comm=Command) as desired.
                 If all column headers are empty (ps -o pid= -o comm=) then the header line
                 will not be output.  Column width will increase as needed for wide headers;
                 this may be used to widen up columns such as
                 WCHAN (ps -o pid,wchan=WIDE-WCHAN-COLUMN -o comm).  Explicit width control
                 (ps opid,wchan:42,cmd) is offered too.  The behavior of ps -o pid=X,comm=Y
                 varies with personality; output may be one column named &quot;X,comm=Y&quot; or two
                 columns named &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;.  Use multiple -o options when in doubt.
                 Use the PS_FORMAT environment variable to specify a default as desired;
                 DefSysV and DefBSD are macros that may be used to choose the default UNIX or
                 BSD columns.

    s         Display signal format.
    u         Display user-oriented format.
    v         Display virtual memory format.
    X         Register format.
   -y         Do not show flags; show rss in place of addr.
              This option can only be used with -l.
    Z         Add a column of security data.  Identical to -M (for SELinux).</pre>
<h2> Output Modifiers:<br>
 </h2>
<pre>
   c              Show the true command name.
                  This is derived from the name of the executable file, rather than
                  from the argv value.  Command arguments and any modifications to them
                  are thus not shown. This option effectively turns the args format
                  keyword into the comm format keyword; it is useful with the -f format
                  option and with the various BSD-style format options, which all normally
                  display the command arguments.  See the -f option, the format keyword
                  <b>args</b>, and the format keyword <b>comm</b>.
   --cols <i>n</i>       Set screen width.
   --columns <i>n</i>    Set screen width.
   --cumulative   Include some dead child process data (as a sum with the parent).

    e             show environment after the command.
    f             ASCII-art process hierarchy (forest).
   --forest       ASCII art process tree.

    h             No header.  (or, one header per screen in the BSD personality).
   -H             Show process hierarchy (forest).
   --headers      Repeat header lines, one per page of output.

    k <i>spec</i>        Specify sorting order.  Sorting syntax is
                  [+|-]key[,[+|-]key[,...]].  Choose a multi-letter key from the
                  <a href="ps_keywords.html">STANDARD FORMAT SPECIFIERS</a>.  The "+" is optional since
                  default direction is increasing numerical or lexicographic order.
                  Identical to --sort.

                      Examples:
                      ps jaxkuid,-ppid,+pid
                      ps axk comm o comm,args
                      ps kstart_time -ef

   --lines        Set screen height.
   -m  m          Show all threads.
   -n             Set namelist file.
   --no-headers   Print no header line at all.--no-heading is an alias for this option.

    n             Numeric output for WCHAN and USER.

    O <i>order</i>       <a href="ps_keywords.html">sorting</a> order (overloaded).
                  The BSD O option can act like -O (user-defined output format with some
                  common fields predefined) or can be used to specify sort order.
                  Heuristics are used to determine the behavior of this option.
                  To ensure that the desired behavior is obtained (sorting or formatting),
                  specify the option in some other way (e.g.  with -O or --sort).

   --rows <i>n</i>       Set screen height.

    S             Sum up some information, such as CPU usage, from dead child processes
                  into their parent. This is useful for examining a system where a parent
                  process repeatedly forks off short-lived children to do work.

   --sort         Specify sorting order.
                  Sorting syntax is [+|-]key[,[+|-]key[,...]].
                  Choose a multi-letter key from the <a href="ps_keywords.html">STANDARD FORMAT SPECIFIERS</a>.
                  The &quot;+&quot; is optional since default direction is increasing numerical or
                  lexicographic order.  Identical to k.
                  For example: ps jax --sort=uid,-ppid, +pid

   -w             Wide output.  Use this option twice for unlimited width.
    w             Wide output.  Use this option twice for unlimited width.
   --width <i>n</i>      Set screen width.
</pre>
<h2> Thread Display<br>
</h2>
<pre>
    H    Show threads as if they were processes.
   -L    Show threads, possibly with LWP and NLWP columns.
    m    Show threads after processes.
   -m    Show threads after processes.
   -T    Show threads, possibly with SPID column.</pre>
<h2> Information<br>
</h2>
<pre>
   --help    Print help message.
   --info    Print debugging info.
    L        List all format specifiers.
   --version Print version.
   -V        Print version.
    V        Print version.</pre>
<p>This <span class="code">ps</span> works by reading the virtual files in /proc.  This <span class="code">ps</span> does        not need to be setuid kmem or have any privileges to run.  Do not        give this ps any special permissions. </p>
<p>CPU usage is currently expressed as the percentage of time spent        running during the entire lifetime of a process.  This is not ideal,        and it does not conform to the standards that ps otherwise conforms        to.  CPU usage is unlikely to add up to exactly 100%.        </p>
<p>The SIZE and RSS fields don't count some parts of a process including        the page tables, kernel stack, struct thread_info, and struct        task_struct.  This is usually at least 20 KiB of memory that is        always resident.  SIZE is the virtual size of the process (code+data+        stack).        </p>
<p>Processes marked &lt;defunct&gt; are dead processes (so-called &quot;zombies&quot;)        that remain because their parent has not destroyed them properly.        These processes will be destroyed by init(8) if the parent process        exits.</p>
<p> If the length of the username is greater than the length of the        display column, the username will be truncated.  See the -o and -O        formatting options to customize length.        </p>
<p>Commands options such as <span class="code">ps -aux</span> are not recommended as it is a        confusion of two different standards.  According to the POSIX and        UNIX standards, the above command asks to display all processes with        a TTY (generally the commands users are running) plus all processes        owned by a user named &quot;x&quot;.  If that user doesn't exist, then ps will        assume you really meant &quot;<span class="code">ps aux</span>&quot;.<br>
<br>
<span class="code">%CPU</span> shows the cputime/realtime percentage. It will  not add up to 100%  unless you are lucky. It is time used divided by the time the process has been running.<br>
<br>
Processes  marked <i>defunct</i> are dead processes (so-called"zombies")  that  remain  because  their parent has not destroyed them properly. These processes will be destroyed by init(8) if the parent process exits.</p>
<pre>PROCESS FLAGS
  The sum of these values is displayed in the "F" column, which is
  provided by the flags output specifier:

   1    forked but didn't exec
   4    used super-user privileges

PROCESS STATE CODES
   D    uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)
   I    Idle kernel thread
   R    running or runnable (on run queue)
   S    interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)
   T    stopped by job control signal
   t    stopped by debugger during the tracing
   W    paging (not valid since the 2.6.xx kernel)
   X    dead (should never be seen)
   Z   a defunct ("zombie") process

For BSD formats and when the "stat" keyword is used, additional letters can be displayed:
   W   has no resident pages
   <   high-priority process
   N   low-priority task
   L   has pages locked into memory (for real-time and custom IO)
   s   is a session leader
   l   is multi-threaded (using CLONE_THREAD, like NPTL pthreads do)
  +    is in the foreground process group
